# Nickless Tekk Blogger

## Description

Our Tekk Blogger application allows registered users to create new posts, edit existing ones or delete irrelevant ones. All of this done through our newly developed dashboard, that helps maintain all of the user's posts in one single place.

The homepage will display all posts created by all users on the platform, and clicking on a post will allow you to see comments that have been left by users on our site.

Enjoy blogging!
